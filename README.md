## Introduction
### Some basics:
> // this is a comment\
> /* this is a comment as well */\
> console.log('Hello World'); // prints out result in console\
> alert('bruh'); // a pop up with message 'bruh'

You can use semicolons in most circumstances at end of statement but you don't have to.

> console.log('Wow this is cool');\
> console.log('Wow this is cool too')\
> console.log('this errors because statement did not end;

You can have a statement span multiple lines

> console.log(1\
> +\
> 2)  // does not error
